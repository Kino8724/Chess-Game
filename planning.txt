Objects: An instance of a class

Overall breakdown:
    This will be a locally downloaded and played, with alternating turns on the keyboard and mouse (as of now)
    Game running on While loop, checking for win to hit true (or stalemate[aka: both players win = true !Check first]), once true, display players name that won

    Classes:
    Player - checkAmount, totalPoints, Color, Win = false (to start), Name
    Piece - Color, Points, inPlay, canMove
        Pawn - only forward, take diagonally (first move of each pawn can move 2 spaces)
        Knight - L shape, any direction
        King - one space, any direction
        Queen - any amount in any direction
        Rook - any amount horizontally and vertically
        Bishop - any amount diagonally

Edge Cases: 
    En Passant - if white pawn is on 5th rank and a black pawn moves 2 spaces ahead on an adjacent file, white can capture the black 
                 pawn only on the turn immediately after the move was played, similarly, if black pawn is on the 4th rank and white 
                 pawn moves 2 spacesahead on an adjacent file, black can capture the white pawn 
    Pawn promotion
    Castling - if the king and rook have not moved, and the king is not in check, and castling would not put the king in check, 
               and the king would not be moving over a square attacked by an enemy piece, and there are no pieces in between the two 
               the king moves 2 spaces to the left or the right (wherever the empty space is) and the rook moves over and in front of 
               the king, all in one move
    Stalemate (draw game, both Players win set to True) *Cases* (Three-fold repetition, 50-move draw, )
    Pinning (piece cant move if it will checkmate the king)

Normal Cases:
    White moves first
    Moving while in Check
    Moving
    Checkmate
    Taking
    Moving only on turn
    Proposal for draw

Optional:

    Time Control for games
    Pre-moving
